# Deep_learning_with_PyTorch
Some heated algorithms and models implemented with PyTorch in the tutorial

## Introduction
The usages of tensor and basic neural network. Illustrate a simple neural network and its procedure of computation.

One more simple CNN is also performed.

## ImageVideo
For images and video type data

### Object Detecting
  dataset: [PennFudan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/PennFudanPed.zip)
Mainly use Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN to do detection and segmentation.
